Hi there! I’m Colin Cao, a PhD candidate in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, the University of Melbourne, advised by Prof XX and Dr XXX.

My research focus is on ion transporation and separation, multi-scalesimulations, and machine learning. Currently, I am working on XX project.

My background is in semiconductor photocatalyst. I received my MSc in Engineering (Materials) from the University of Melbourne in 2021.

Feel free to contact me (colawithrain@gmail.com) in case you have interest or questions regarding my work.
