## Symbolic regression preliminary result and problems

### Problem

Cannot get the accurate description of PMF profile

### Solutions

1. Add self-defined function based on domain knowledge (e.g. insert an item from the empirical equation mentioned in the paper
2. Try to use only the local trend as input, rather than the whole PMF profile
3. Add local minimum position as a feature, to let algorithm notice that local minimum is a key factor (since the prediction model always ignore the local minimum feature

## Feasibility of doing GAN study on Graphene structure and ECM

### ECM model refinement

ECM model is derived from the electrochemistry test or the continuum modelling result, the output of ECM is a V-I curve. ECM has no explicit relationship with the graphene structure.

It is feasible to generate ECM using GAN until one can get a model accurate enough. 

But there is a drawback that ECM model itself is not 100 % accepted by the academia since its simplification, if it is generated by ML algorithm, it could be even harder to emphasise its science significance.

### MGMs accurate microstructure prediction

It is feasible, but need to figure out how to validate the accuracy of the model.
